# CryptoClustering
This is a Python and Unsupervised ML challenge
The purpose of this challenge was to explore the concept of unsupervised learning, focusing on the K-means clustering algorithm, with a particular emphasis on clustering, a technique used to group data points based on similarities. Through the application of K-means, it was learned how the algorithm automatically identifies clusters within data. To determine the optimal number of clusters,  the elbow method was used, a popular technique for visualizing and selecting the right number of clusters. 

This challenge also covered essential preprocessing steps for unsupervised learning, emphasizing the importance of data normalization and scaling. It brought some exposure to transforming categorical variables into numerical representations using Pandas, followed by the application of the StandardScaler from scikit-learn to scale the data. This preparation of the data is crucial for improving the performance of clustering algorithms like K-means. Additionally,  Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied, a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data. By applying PCA is possible to see how reducing the number of features can help enhance the effectiveness of unsupervised learning models.

The notebook file where the code is located is called "Crypto_Clustering" and its data file is inside the folder named "Resources"

Most of the help used to complete this challenge came from class notes. For debugging issues, ChatGPT was used. For the composite plots, sample code from ChatGPT was also used as I really did not understand what to do.
